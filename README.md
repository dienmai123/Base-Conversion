# Base-Conversion
Converting any base number to a desired base

* Developed a versatile base conversion application that can process numerical inputs in any base, including characters from 'A' to 'Z'. Implemented efficient algorithms to convert input strings to base-10 BigIntegers and then to the desired target base, resulting in accurate and efficient base conversion.
